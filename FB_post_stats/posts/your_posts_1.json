I hope that two cars don't try to avoid each other and in turn hit an elementary school kid.  He gave me some real BS excuses to why people should already know how this very uncommon intersection works and who should yield to who.  He said putting in stop signs gives other people on the non-stop sign side the excuse to speed up... Even though the other street wouldn't even see the sign because of how this intersection is laid out.  He said if there is a crash then the one at fault would be the one in trouble.  Then I stumped him with \"Who's at fault, if there are no signs?\".  \"The city only places stop signs at intersections that get 2000+ cars a day\"... I can only think of a few places that might get that many cars a day and they all have signal lights anyways.  Well the next accident I see I will be sure to document it and put the photos on this guys desk."

These kinds of things you think to yourself that you'll never actually find them or what are the chances.  My chances were high today I guess.  After I looked up the info on www.amissingchild.com I decided to start my work out and go for a couple mile run. Half way through I see a young girl fitting the description so I thought for a bit what to do since I did not bring my phone this time. Luckily a women was coming from her house and I asked to use hers. told the cops whats up and where she was heading, I followed her all discretely until I saw a cop a couple blocks over and flagged him down.  She was not happy to see him, she was definitely a run away and he said she had done it before. Well that's my good deed for the year. Missed my appointment at school because of it too."

Got a sweet deal and an even better deal today.  Since the one they were originally trying to get (same thing but black interior) sold they got this new one that just got off the truck yesterday (meaning even newer than the other) and comes with even more extras.  Since we already made the deal and locked it the price of what I will pay, I'm not being charged anymore for this more expensive car. Even though I didn't get my black interior I got a sweet deal overall. Should be picking it up Wednesday morning. Thank you to my friend Mike for the online help in car buying, I feel like a got a good win with this purchase.\n\nPics coming soon...\n\nP.S. I know I did good and the sales lady I worked said I did good because she showed me the sales person board in the office and pointed out that she made no extra money off this deal while other people made around 180 from other car buyers that didn't do as much research.  Luckily with most dealers she said she gets a percentage from the manufacturer and state for selling a car so I don't feel bad."

The song was written and produced by group member will.i.am for their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005). It was released as the band's third single from the album on September 20, 2005, due in part to the strength of downloads preceding the release. Musically, \"My Humps\" is a hip hop and dance song that is structured as a duet between will.i.am and Fergie. The song sparked controversy because of its title and lyrics, which center on a woman who uses her breasts and buttocks to accomplish her goals.",

Started running for fun and fitness the summer of 13' and was never interested in racing when I could just run for free. At the end of last year I re began my training after my motorcycle accident and surgery. I never thought I would run or workout out to my best again. Since October I have pushed my limits and become even stronger and faster. In January I participated in my first over 8 mile race (Cascade half marathon) and found out I run a lot faster than I expected. That got me hooked on going the distance. Not long after, my best running inspiration/competition decided to help coach me on the side and on her time to make me a better all around runner. Coach Kate has put up with my runner n00b questions to help me begin to get past being a baby runner (someday ;) ) . Couldn't have done it without her. Also the enormous support and advice I receive from my favorite running husband/wife duo, John and Susan Gallagher. These two support so many people in this community through the work they do in and out of the store. I recommend that everyone go there whether you are a runner/walker or just love a comfy work shoe, come join the running club. \n\nToday was the first marathon attempt I have taken and did exactly what I wanted to do, complete it and try to do it in under 4 hours. From this point on I will make myself better until I reach my goal to BQ and get to Boston within the next 5 years. After mile 18 I was starting to see \"The Wall\" and a couple miles later there it was. I pushed through the best I could and then was very surprised coming to the finish line when I heard my name yelled not thinking I would even know anyone around. The parents Johnny and Eileen said they would probably not make it but sacrificed some sleep to support me anyways (you can see dad running next to me on the other side of the fence). A great surprise. Unfortunately I had a \"tight\" recovery window at the beach and did have to long to spend there at the finish line. Walked a steep hill (ugh) to the car then raced to the hotel before checkout which I squeezed them out for 12:30, for the chilling ice bath (it helped). After that the long drive home for some R&R. \n\nNewport Marathon, 2017- Complete! \n3:51:22 finish time. \n\n#marathon #first #running #newportoregon #goals #PR"

Going to get them soon and will be the test guinea pig for the store to see if they should stock them. I will gladly be the test dummy to get some shoes out of it. \n\nAlso, I have noticed that my wardrobe lately is growing and mostly consisting of running gear from all the free SWAG I get going to events.

It took me no time to love it and start thinking of how it would fit and look and what I wanted to do with it. I'm hooked! #tattoosforlife #sparenoexpense"

Was trying to go sub 19 min for the time but didn't quit get there. Hills... it was a great race and I had a fantastic time helping get things ready for the races these last few weeks. Next year will be the year I hit all goals. Big thanks to my coach Kate(#1 woman racer) for helping me through these past couple months. We got it next time for sure. Also awesome to see Matt Fitzgerald again since the Eugene marathon. He killed it of course, well done. Also was able to get the parents out there for some fun. Next time they have to run the whole thing.",

The Silver Falls 7-miler was around the 10 falls and a bit of extra. Went into it thinking I would maybe get a pace of 8:45m/mile since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never run a trail and do not have the proper shoes (which made me nervous about slipping, only rolled my ankle once... it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit sore now). I started in the front and thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just see how it went from there. Well it turns out I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty good on or off the paved paths. For the first 5-ish miles I kept up with a locally know star Tonya and kept a 7:15ish pace. After that around the lower south falls before the stairs I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see what I could do. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go faster since it was all up hill but I left everyone behind and passed 3 more people. The up slope and stairs are tough. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even imagine what the other people are feeling doing the marathon and 50k. Felt good to finish 6th overall and first in my division with a time of 55:33. I am extra tired. Good job to all my friends running the longer races and being volunteers too! \n#beatyesterday"

Then hung out for a bit while friends came across the finish line. Then it was the 12mile trip back home taking the Schurman hill \"shortcut\", ow. Great job to all that did the race and bettered themselves from last year or made their mark for the first time to come back next year and smash it."

I went out with the leaders as usual, but slowed down because I was way ahead of my wanted end time. At this race last year I earned my #PR of 18:27 and was so happy to break the 19min point. This year is the year I wanted to brake the 18min point. Somehow I did it today, just barely. Looks like I have to set some higher #goals for #Eola. Thank you everyone for the support and congrats today. Also congrats to everyone else who ran it and made their goals in the race you ran today.  #corvallisrunning #fallfestivalrun Heart Of The Valley Runners Willamette Valley Road Runners Gallagher Fitness Resources\n\nEdit: also looks like I got a new mile PR. 5:19.2"

At least I happy that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt at all the next day. Looks like I might be good to start building a new foundation.

After that we were off to another set of #hikes. Just across the #bridge and down the road it was Cascadia campgrounds. Soda Falls and Soda Spring Trail. We we got there and a guy said there was some sort of animal on animal attack at the end where the cave was... Well it was not a cave and not an attack. More like someone brushed or sheered their husky. But we did find so extra nice water #views past the end of the trail. A nice dinner stop at #Barsidious Brewing in Lebanon, damn good fry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and tots."

Then again at 4am Alison went out and sat in a driveway for almost an hour until he finally came close and realized a person was there. Army crawled with caution towards her then tackled her with excitement once he knew. This was him at 5:30am coming home and greeting me at the bed then he quickly remembered where he sleeps and acted like all was normal again. What a little turd. Glad he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back though. Time to start some real training soon. Oh and time to purchase a GPS collar."

Plus there was a great post race lunch and wine/beer. Had me a little Pinot Gris, yummmm. Also was very nice to see some old faces that I haven't in a long time."

I went out with the leaders as usual, but slowed down because I was way ahead of my wanted end time. At this race last year I earned my #PR of 18:27 and was so happy to break the 19min point. This year is the year I wanted to brake the 18min point. Somehow I did it today, just barely. Looks like I have to set some higher #goals for #Eola. Thank you everyone for the support and congrats today. Also congrats to everyone else who ran it and made their goals in the race you ran today.  #corvallisrunning #fallfestivalrun Heart Of The Valley Runners Willamette Valley Road Runners Gallagher Fitness Resources\n\nEdit: also looks like I got a new mile PR. 5:19.2"

Then again at 4am Alison went out and sat in a driveway for almost an hour until he finally came close and realized a person was there. Army crawled with caution towards her then tackled her with excitement once he knew. This was him at 5:30am coming home and greeting me at the bed then he quickly remembered where he sleeps and acted like all was normal again. What a little turd. Glad he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back though. Time to start some real training soon. Oh and time to purchase a GPS collar."

Halfway through the test I had doubts and really thought I was in trouble. Thankfully the outcome was better than I could have asked.

Feeling good race day I was planning to do the last leg which is a flat 4.5 miles. Last minute change and I took leg 4 of almost 7 miles downhill and flat.  Turned out feeling and doing great. Today is another story though. My legs are dead. Our team did manage to place 1st out of the RWB teams that came by 2 minutes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take it. Looking forward to next year. @teamrwb @team_rwb_salem_or #eaglefire"

I wanted to get on here and let everyone know that I have not told already that I recently acquired a new job which has me relocating to the north Seattle area. Since January I have participated in a Network Engineering Development program through a company in Bellevue, WA called TLG Learning. With their assistance I was able to get a couple great CompTIA certifications and other useful skills for the field. I had thought since the beginning that they were going to help me get a job in this new field and they did not disappoint. In fact they offered me a position within their own company (I guess I did alright through the program). So my expected last day in Oregon (for now) is May 28th. I just signed the lease for my new place up in the north Seattle area today and will be finishing out my last two weeks of work here and then preparing to move for the next week. I will miss everyone very much but I know I will be back often for running events and definitely for family get togethers. This is no a goodbye but a see you soon."

I did not think this would happen so quick and smooth or even that I would be joining their ranks when I started going through their Network Development Engineering course back in January, but thanks to Karise Swainson it was meant to be. I have to thank Mark Gorman for getting me very interested and started in the program. Then to all my instructors (Cliff Jones, John Kacmarynski, Hussein Abdirahman) that helped me pass my Network+, Linux+ and AWS certifications, they made it much easier to grasp than doing it alone. I now get to support so many people like me going through course to get the training and certifications they want to either advance their career or start a new one.  #newjob #career #network #engineering #development",

Pioneer Square has seen it all: Broadsides from battleships, mob lynchings, gunfights right out of a Clint Eastwood movie, Indian attacks right out of a John Wayne movie.

The simply named Fin Art in Seattle's Magnuson Park is a larger-than-life work of recycled art that turns a grassy field into teeming ocean.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nLocated just off the shore of Lake Washington, the large, black shapes that comprise the public art piece resemble nothing so much as a pod of killer whales, peeking their fins above the waterline. Upon closer inspection, what seemed to be fins are revealed to be painted metal monoliths planted in the ground at irregular angles and intervals creating a sense of live motion. The pieces are in fact decommissioned submarine wings that each weigh 10,000 pounds. This use of military ordinance to create public art which celebrates life is far more affecting than the simple title of Fin Art would suggest."

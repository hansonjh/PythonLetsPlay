Just across the #bridge and down the road it was Cascadia campgrounds. Soda Falls and Soda Spring Trail. We we got there and a guy said there was some sort of animal on animal attack at the end where the cave was... Well it was not a cave and not an attack. More like someone brushed or sheered their husky. But we did find so extra nice water #views past the end of the trail. A nice dinner stop at #Barsidious Brewing in Lebanon, damn good fry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and tots."
